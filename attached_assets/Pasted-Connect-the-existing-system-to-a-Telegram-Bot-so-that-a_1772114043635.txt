Connect the existing system to a Telegram Bot so that all functionality works through Telegram.

Bot Token: 8582140783:AAEeX5iL_2nQEFlMKYIxGoquNDvDfEs8LRI

The bot must operate exactly like the current main engine (hosted on Replit). The Telegram bot should act as an interface layer while keeping the same backend logic and server structure.
